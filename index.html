                An aspiring software engineer with a passion for developing and solving problems.
                <span class="about-highlight">I am currently a lab demonstrator for a programming module</span>,
                as a lab demonstrator I assist fellow students with queries and issues that they may encounter.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I have experience with many programming languages, however the ones that I love to work with are:
                Java and HTML, CSS and JS. I've used many frameworks and libraries like swing for java GUI and nodeJS 
                for backend in JS. In the future I hope to put my skills to use and solve problems.
                <span class="about-highlight">I am currently also seeking an industrial placement for my 3rd year</span>.

                    I have built many projects with multiple languages, ranging from:

                        <p>
                            This application was <span class="projects-highlight">written using swing</span> and was
                            created to allow users to cipher data between each others, securly. This is
                            <span class="projects-highlight">my most well presented, well documented and most modern GUI application</span>
                            that I've ever written. It utilizes a ciphering library that I have wrote to cipher data.

                            This is a <span class="projects-highlight">ciphering library that ciphers data</span>. It

                            <span class="projects-highlight">encrypted</span> multiple times.
                            It is also quite well documented and has examples in the README.
